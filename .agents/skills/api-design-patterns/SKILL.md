| #   | Pattern                | Problem Solved                      | Key Mechanic               |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Versioning             | Breaking changes when evolving APIs | URL prefix `/v1/`, `/v2/`  |
| 2   | Pagination             | Returning too much data at once     | `?page=&limit=` + meta     |

| 6   | Async Request-Response | Long-running tasks timing out       | `jobId` + polling endpoint |
| 7   | Consistent Response    | Inconsistent success/error shapes   | Unified envelope structure |

---

## Pattern 1 — Versioning Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Change without breaking the past._

Every long-lived API must evolve. Versioning lets you introduce breaking changes
while old clients continue working undisturbed.

### When to use

- Changing field names or data structures
- Adding/removing fields in a breaking way
- Changing business logic that affects response shape

### Implementation

```
GET /v1/users/123    →  Users Service Version 1  (legacy clients)
GET /v2/users/123    →  Users Service Version 2  (new clients)
```

**v1 response (old):**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

**v2 response (evolved safely):**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "0912345678",
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": "2024-05-18T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Rules

- **Never** mutate an existing version in a breaking way — add a new version instead.
- Deprecate old versions gracefully with sunset headers: `Sunset: Sat, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT`
- Common strategies: URL path (`/v2/`), header (`API-Version: 2`), query param (`?version=2`).
  URL path is the most visible and widely adopted.

### Golden Rule

> Any API that lives long enough **must** have a version strategy. Don't "fix in place" — add a new version. That's how APIs survive long-term.

---

## Pattern 2 — Pagination Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Don't return 100,000 records just because you can._

When data is large, split results into pages. Good for the server, good for the client.

### Request structure

```
GET /users?page=2&limit=10&sort=createdAt&search=john
```

| Parameter | Description                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `page`    | Current page number (starts at 1) |
| `limit`   | Number of items per page          |
| `sort`    | Sort field (optional)             |
| `search`  | Search term (optional)            |

### Response structure

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 11, "name": "Alice" },
    { "id": 12, "name": "Bob" }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 1000,
    "totalPages": 100,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrevious": true
  }
}
```

### Don't vs Do

| ❌ Don't                      | ✅ Do                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Return all records at once    | Return small pages, just enough            |
| No metadata about total count | Always include `meta` with pagination info |
| Ignore `limit` parameter      | Enforce a maximum limit (e.g. 100)         |

### Benefits

- **Faster** responses
- **Reduces** server and database load
- **Better** user experience
- **Easier** to scale

### Alternative: Cursor-based pagination

For large, real-time datasets use cursors instead of page numbers:

```
GET /users?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTJ9&limit=10
```

Response includes `nextCursor` instead of `page`. More efficient for
deep pagination and live data.

> **Golden Rule:** Pagination saves both the database and the user experience. Don't let a good API become a system bottleneck.

---

## Pattern 3 — Filtering Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Let the client decide what data to fetch._

Allow clients to filter data by multiple criteria so they get exactly what they need — no more, no less.

### Request example

```
GET /users?active=true&role=admin&createdAt>=2024-01-01
```

### Common filter parameters

| Parameter               | Meaning                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `active=true`           | Filter active users only        |
| `role=admin`            | Filter by role                  |
| `createdAt>=2024-01-01` | Filter by creation date         |
| `email~=@gmail.com`     | Partial match / search by email |
| `sort=-createdAt`       | Sort descending by field        |
| `limit=20&page=1`       | Combine with pagination         |

### Response example

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 15, "name": "John Doe", "role": "admin", "active": true },
    { "id": 28, "name": "Jane Smith", "role": "admin", "active": true }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 42,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 3
  }
}
```

### Real-world use cases

- **User management:** filter by role, status, creation date
- **Order management:** filter by status, customer, time range
- **Reports/analytics:** multi-criteria data filtering

### Benefits

- Client is flexible and self-sufficient
- Reduces server and database load
- Saves bandwidth and improves performance
- API is flexible and extensible
- Better user experience

> **Golden Rule:** A flexible API lives longer than a rigid one. Give filtering power to the client.

---

## Pattern 4 — Field Selection Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Send only what the client needs._

Clients don't always need all fields. If a screen only shows name and avatar,
don't send 20+ other fields. Bandwidth costs money.

### Request

```
GET /users/123?fields=id,name,avatar
```

The `fields` parameter specifies a comma-separated list of fields to return.

### Without vs With Field Selection

**Without (returns all fields):**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "0912345678",
  "address": "123 Street, Hanoi",
  "role": "admin",
  "avatar": "https://.../avatar.jpg",
  "createdAt": "2024-05-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-05-10T09:20:00Z",
  "lastLogin": "2024-05-15T08:00:00Z",
  "orders": [...],
  "transactions": [...],
  "preferences": {...}
}
```

**With `?fields=id,name,avatar` (lean response):**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "avatar": "https://.../avatar.jpg"
}
```

### Implementation notes

- Always have a **default field list** for when client sends no `fields` param
- **Validate** requested fields (avoid leaking sensitive data)
- Can be combined with pagination and filtering
- Support **aliases/presets** for common field groups:

```
?fields=basic    → id, name, avatar
?fields=detail   → id, name, email, phone, address
?fields=profile  → id, name, avatar, bio, website
```

### Benefits

- Smaller response size
- Saves bandwidth
- Faster data transfer
- Mobile apps and web clients load faster
- Reduces server and database load

> **Golden Rule:** Send exactly what the client needs — not more, not less. Bandwidth is money.

---

## Pattern 5 — Expansion Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Fetch related data in a single call._

Instead of making multiple API calls for related resources, the client can
"expand" the resources it needs. Fewer requests, better performance, cleaner API.

### Request

```
GET /users/123?expand=profile,orders
```

| Part             | Meaning                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `expand`         | The query parameter                         |
| `profile,orders` | Comma-separated related resources to expand |

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "profile": {
      "bio": "Full-stack developer",
      "avatar": "https://.../avatar.jpg",
      "phone": "0912345678"
    },
    "orders": [
      { "id": 1, "total": 120000, "status": "paid" },
      { "id": 2, "total": 250000, "status": "pending" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### How it works

1. Client requests the main resource and specifies related resources via `expand`
2. Server returns the main resource **plus** the related resources inline

### Without vs With Expansion

```
❌ Without Expansion (3 requests):
GET /users/123        →  user data
GET /users/123/profile →  profile data
GET /users/123/orders  →  orders data

✅ With Expansion (1 request):
GET /users/123?expand=profile,orders  →  everything at once
```

### Benefits

- Fewer requests (3 → 1)
- Better performance, lower latency
- Keeps API clean — no need to create many sub-endpoints
- Client controls what data it needs

### Pro tip

Combine expansion with field selection for maximum optimization:

```
GET /users/123?expand=profile,orders&fields=id,name,profile.bio,orders.id,orders.total
```

> **Golden Rule:** Get all related data in one call. Your client (and your network) will thank you.

---

## Pattern 6 — Async Request-Response Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Not everything finishes in 3 seconds._

For long-running tasks (seconds, minutes, or more), don't force the client to
wait until timeout. Process asynchronously and return a `jobId`.

### Process flow

```
1. POST /reports          →  202 Accepted  (server creates job, returns jobId)
2. GET /jobs/{jobId}      →  200 OK        (client polls for status)
3. GET /reports/{id}.csv  →  200 OK        (client downloads result when done)
```

### Step 1 — Create task (Request)

```
POST /reports
{
  "type": "sales-report",
  "params": {
    "from": "2024-05-01",
    "to": "2024-05-31"
  }
}
```

**Response: `202 Accepted`**

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "pending",
  "statusUrl": "/jobs/a1b2c3d4"
}
```

### Step 2 — Poll for status

```
GET /jobs/a1b2c3d4
```

**While processing:**

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 45
}
```

**When complete:**

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "completed",
  "resultUrl": "/reports/a1b2c3d4.csv"
}
```

### Step 3 — Download result

```
GET /reports/a1b2c3d4.csv
```

### When to use

- Generating large reports or statistics
- Sending bulk emails/SMS
- Processing video, images, large files
- AI/ML training or inference
- Any task that takes significant time

### Benefits

| Benefit                 | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Better UX               | Client doesn't wait for timeout                    |
| Reduces server load     | Processing in background, no long-held connections |
| Stability & reliability | Easy to retry, easy to scale, low risk             |
| Monitoring & control    | Know progress and status of every task             |

### Pro tip

Combine with **Webhook / SSE / WebSocket** to push notifications when the job
completes — instead of having the client poll continuously.

> **Golden Rule:** Don't force clients to wait. Return a `jobId`, process in the background, let them check back.

---

## Pattern 7 — Consistent Response Pattern

**Philosophy:** _Consistent responses — easy to use, easy to extend, easy to maintain._

A great API isn't just about good requests. It's about responding consistently
in every situation — success, client error, server error.

### Recommended response envelope

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Successfully retrieved user list",
  "data": [{ "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }],
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-05-20T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/users",
    "requestId": "c0a801f2-8b7e-4d3f-a1c2-4b9b0d9e7b1a"
  }
}
```

| Field        | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `success`    | Overall boolean status                          |
| `statusCode` | HTTP status code (mirrored in body)             |
| `message`    | Human-readable description                      |
| `data`       | Returned payload (if any)                       |
| `meta`       | Supplementary info (timestamp, path, requestId) |

### 1. Success Response — `200 OK`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Alice"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-05-20T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 2. Client Error Response — `400 Bad Request`

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Invalid data",
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "details": [{ "field": "email", "message": "Invalid email format" }]
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-05-20T10:31:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 3. Server Error Response — `500 Internal Server Error`

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "System error, please try again later",
  "error": {
    "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
    "details": "Cannot connect to database"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-05-20T10:32:00Z",
    "requestId": "c0a801f2-8b7e-4d3f-a1c2-4b9b0d9e7b1a"
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

| Practice                                       | Why                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Always keep response structure consistent      | Client can parse reliably       |
| Use clear, readable `message` text             | Reduces debugging time          |
| Never leak sensitive system info               | Security                        |
| Use `code` in errors for programmatic handling | Client can branch on error type |
| Log with `requestId` for easy tracing          | Operations and debugging        |

### Benefits

- Client can parse and handle responses easily
- Fewer bugs from inconsistent formats
- Extend API without impacting clients
- Clearer, more professional API documentation

> **Golden Rule:** Document your response structure clearly in API docs so every client handles responses the same way.

---

## Combining Patterns

These patterns compose well together. Real-world API calls often use several at once:

```
GET /v2/users?
  active=true&role=admin        ← Filtering
  &page=1&limit=20              ← Pagination
  &fields=id,name,avatar        ← Field Selection
  &expand=profile               ← Expansion
  &sort=-createdAt              ← Sorting (part of Filtering)
```

**Layered optimization:**

```
/v2/users/123
  ?expand=profile,orders
  &fields=id,name,profile.bio,orders.id,orders.total
  &orders.status=paid
```

---

## Design Checklist

Before shipping any API endpoint, verify:

- [ ] Does it have a version? (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)
- [ ] Does it paginate large collections?
- [ ] Does it support filtering by relevant fields?
- [ ] Does it support `?fields=` for field selection?
- [ ] Does it support `?expand=` for related resources?
- [ ] Are long tasks handled asynchronously (jobId)?
- [ ] Is the response envelope consistent across success, 4xx, and 5xx?
- [ ] Is `requestId` included for traceability?
- [ ] Are error messages clear without leaking internals?
- [ ] Is everything documented?

| 429  | Too Many Requests     | Rate limit exceeded                     |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server-side bug                         |
| 503  | Service Unavailable   | Server is down or overloaded            |

## Integration with System Design & 3-Layer Documentation

This skill serves as the detailed API specification specialist in the engineering lifecycle.

### 1. Inbound Handoff from `system-design`
When an architecture design exposes public or internal APIs, `system-design` produces an **API Surface Summary**:
- **Context & Consumers**: Target callers (Mobile, SPA, 3rd party webhooks).
- **Protocols & Auth**: REST / WebSocket, JWT / OAuth2 / API Key.
- **Endpoints Matrix**: HTTP Method, Route path, latency targets, caching rules.
- **Identified Constraints**: Async job offloading, high-volume cursor pagination, partial payload requirements.

`api-design-patterns` consumes this summary and applies the 7 patterns to create complete, production-grade API specifications.

### 2. Output Destinations (3-Layer Documentation Standard)
In accordance with the project's [documentation](../documentation/SKILL.md) skill:

- **System-Wide API Invariants**:
  - File: `docs/architecture/08-integration-architecture.md`
  - Content: Global response envelope (`{ data, meta, error }`), standard pagination parameters (`?page=&limit=`), global error code catalog, auth header conventions, rate limit headers.
- **Release-Specific Endpoint Specifications**:
  - File: `docs/implementation/{release}/api/vX.md` (e.g. `docs/implementation/release-1/api/v1.md`)
  - Content: Full parameter definitions, request body schemas, response payloads, query filters, field selectors, and async job polling routes for that milestone.
