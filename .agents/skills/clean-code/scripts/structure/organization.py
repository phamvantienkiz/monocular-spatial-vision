"""Whether each folder holds one concept: families, junk drawers, flat folders, dead and
over-commented files, and the moves that would fix them.

The misplaced finder judges symbols against their roles' homes; these findings judge folders
and whole files. Files that share a concept and import each other belong in a folder named for
it (Common Closure Principle, Screaming Architecture); a folder named for no concept collects
unrelated code (G17); a crowded folder hides its groups (CCP, CRP); a file nothing reaches may
be dead (G9); a file mostly comments is a candidate for the comment workflow (C1-C5, G12).
plan_moves turns the findings into moves for an audit to confirm. Evidence for judgement,
never a verdict.
